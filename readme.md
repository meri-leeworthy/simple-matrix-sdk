# Simple Matrix SDK (Typescript)

My goal is to make a very simple SDK for the Matrix protocol, mostly to help with personal projects. Some things guiding my development:

- Loose preference for functional patterns; immutability, pure functions etc
- Minimal dependencies
- Use async/await and promises rather than callbacks
- Type safety
- Not a full implementation of the Matrix spec, just the parts I need
- Focus on non-chat applications

Pull requests/issues/ideas welcome :)
